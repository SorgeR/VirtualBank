#**React Native Starter Setup**

1. Start with the Create-React-Native-App from [https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) like:  
   ```

   $ create-react-native-app my-project --scripts-version=react-native-scripts-ts  
   $ cd my-project
